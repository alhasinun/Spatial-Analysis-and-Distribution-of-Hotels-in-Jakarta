# Spatial-Analysis-and-Distribution-of-Hotels-in-Jakarta

### Welcome to this repository of spatial analysis of hotels in Jakarta!
**Note**: If you want to see the the full analysis and the process, please check the '*Spatial Analysis of and Distribution of Hotels in Jakarta*' ipynb file.\
\
In this repository, I was doing some simple spatial analysis of hotel distribution in Jakarta, I did some geocoding process to provide the spatial information. The hotel data can be acquired from website of Open Data Jakarta. SHP file can be downloaded from the internet. I have uploaded the necessary files if you are curious and want to do it by yourself.\
\
I advised you to download the html of the interactive map in order for you to interactively use it, because you won't be able to see it in the notebook. If there are some corrections, please let me know. Hope it is an insightful analysis.
Enjoy!!

In short, i conduct analysis on hotel distribution in Jakarta with 3 methods;\

1. **The statistical plot**, which only shows the bar plot between total number of hotels and star-rated hotels in each Jakarta region, and top ten hotels which have the most number of rooms.\
  a. Total number of hotels in each Jakarta region

2. **Static Map**, which shows the maps of total number of hotels in each Jakarta. In addition to that, it can also visualize the distribution of hotels across Jakarta.\

3. **Interactive Map**, which shows the hotels distribution across Jakarta with more interactive visualization that can give you a popup if the icon was clicked, and also has a tool to measure distance and area.\
(*For this map, I advise you to download the html of the interactive map in order for you to interactively use it, because you won't be able to use it in the notebook*)
