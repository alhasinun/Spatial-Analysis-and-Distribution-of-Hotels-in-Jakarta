In this repository, I was doing some simple spatial analysis of hotel distribution in Jakarta, I did some geocoding process to provide the spatial information. The hotel data can be acquired from website of Open Data Jakarta. SHP file can be downloaded from the internet. I have uploaded the necessary files if you are curious and want to do it by yourself.\
